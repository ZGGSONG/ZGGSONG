### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

@zggsong, Hello, I am a software development engineer currently working at a semiconductor company using C# (WPF) for software development. In my spare time, I enjoy learning some interesting technologies and trying to write my own demos or small tools.

In addition, I will share some of my study and life records on my [blog](https://www.zggsong.com). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focus on client and web technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang.
- ðŸ“« you can reach me with [zggsong@foxmail.com](mailto:zggsong@foxmail.com).
- âš¡ Fun fact: Trying to learn more and translate what I have learned into practical software or help people...
