### Hi there 👋

@zggsong, I graduated from Anhui University of Technology, School of Computer Science and Technology. I am currently working in a manufacturing company using C# and Golang for software development. In my spare time I will learn some interesting technologies and try to write some demos or gadgets by myself

In addition, I will share some of my study and life records on my [blog](https://www.zggsong.com). 

- 🔭 I’m currently focus on client and web technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang.
- 📫 you can reach me with [zggsong@foxmail.com](mailto://zggsong@foxmail.com).
- ⚡ Fun fact: Trying to learn more and translate what I have learned into practical software or help people...
